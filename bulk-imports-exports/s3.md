# Amazon S3

## What is Amazon \(AWS\) S3?

Amazon S3 is a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. 

Similar to FTP/SFTP, it allows external tools and services to store and retrieve large amounts of data.

## When to use S3?

Using S3 is recommended for uploads of data to Zaius on a scheduled basis from external systems. Common examples of recurring uploads include:

1. Product Feeds
2. Customer Updates
3. List Subscriptions
4. Consent Updates

## Generate S3 Credentials

#### 1. Go to [Account Settings -&gt; Administration -&gt; Integrations](https://app.zaius.com/app?#/integrations)

#### 2. Select the AWS tile

#### 3. Select "Generate Access Keys"
