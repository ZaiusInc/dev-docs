# Event Inspector

Since every data update in Zaius results in underlying events, the **Event Inspector** is a helpful way to troubleshoot data as it comes into Zaius. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Although customer and object updates are processed as events, the events are not stored.
{% endhint %}

The Event Inspector is located at [Account Settings -&gt; Event Inspector](https://app.zaius.com/app?=#/event_inspector).

To start monitoring for incoming events, select **Start Inspector**. Events will start being collected and the table can display the latest collected data by clicking **Refresh**.
